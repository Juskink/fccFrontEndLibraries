//This creates an ES6 class MyComponent which extends the React.Component class. 
//So the MyComponent class now has access to many useful React features, such as local state and lifecycle hooks. 
// Also notice the MyComponent class has a constructor defined within it that calls super(). 
//It uses super() to call the constructor of the parent class, in this case React.Component. 
//The constructor is a special method used during the initialization of OBJECTS that are created with the CLASS keyword. 
//It is best practice to call a component's constructor with super, and pass props to both. 
//This makes sure the component is initialized properly. For now, know that it is standard for this code to be included. 
//Soon you will see other uses for the constructor as well as props.
